          CHRIST MGOCSM, which began its operations in 2014, celebrates its 10th anniversary this year, marking a decade of spiritual growth, community engagement, and service. Regular prayer sessions every Saturday at St. Thomas Forane Church and Holy Qurbana services at Block 2 Chapel and Precious Blood Missionaries nurture the spiritual well-being of members. Community meetups, including gatherings at various locations like St. Thomas Church, Block 4 Basement, Birds Park, and Pistachio Cafe, strengthen relationships and foster a sense of belonging. Special events such as farewell ceremonies, badge distributions, Carol Night, and meetings with dignitaries like His Grace Dr. Abraham Mar Seraphim Metropolitan enrich the community experience. Hosting deacons from the Orthodox Theological Seminary, festive gatherings like Christmas lights with Dennis Shemashen, and trips such as the memorable visit to Thadagam, Coimbatore, create cherished memories and deepen friendships. Musical jamming sessions and special prayers during Nineveh Lent and Great Lent periods provide spiritual sustenance and artistic expression. The highlight event, Enchristo'24, featured notable MGOCSM leaders and was widely recognized in the media. CHRIST MGOCSM remains steadfast in its mission to nurture the faith of its members and serve the community with love and compassion, looking forward to continuing this journey of faith and service in the years to come.
